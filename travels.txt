I spent 6 weeks in southern Germany in the beginning of 2016. It was the most beautiful place I've ever seen! The winter snow, mountains, food and sheer history of Bavaria is captivating. I went on tours cultivated by the guide that was an expat, German historian with all sorts of interesting details.
